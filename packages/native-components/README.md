# @storybook/native-components
This module contains React components that allow you to interact with appetize.io. This lets you take advantage of controls, as well as add-ons.

## Installation
This package is included within the `@storybook/native` package already, so if you have that as a dependency you do not need to manually install this.

If you are not using that package, use one of these commands to install this package:
`npm install @storybook/native-components`
or
`yarn add @storybook/native-components`

## Usage
`import { EmulatorRenderer } from '@storybook/native-components';`

An example usage can be found [here](../../examples/controls/src/button.stories.jsx)
