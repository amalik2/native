Storybook Native is an extension of the normal web storybook that uses [appetize.io](https://appetize.io/) to render your mobile application in an emulator that can be interacted with from your browser. It allows you to use many of the features that are available in the web storybook, such as addons, controls, etc.

### Installation
If you want to use this module as a build tool that generates stories from metadata, [follow the instructions here](packages/native/README.md). This is recommended if you do not want to write any React code, and you will only have to write some basic JavaScript code.

If you want to use this module to render an emulator as a 
lightweight React component, [follow the instructions here](packages/native-components/README.md). This is recommended if you are already familiar with React and Storybook, or if you want to use features such as addons and controls.

## Configuring your mobile application
Before using this module, your mobile application must be set up to support switching between stories. There are detailed instructions on this [here](APP-CONFIG.md)

## Uploading your mobile application
After you have modified your application to support launch parameters or query parameters, you must upload your application to [appetize.io](https://appetize.io/). After the upload, you will receive a **public key** that can be used with Storybook Native to view and interact with your application directly from Storybook.

## Setting up Storybook
Once your application is uploaded to appetize.io, you can begin setting up Storybook Native. The details for this can be found [here](./STORYBOOK-CONFIG.md)

If you are already familiar with Storybook, the TLDR is that you would set up a `.storybook` folder similar to how you would with the web Storybook, and then create your `.jsx` or `.tsx` files that render stories.

### Examples
Examples of how to use this module as both a build tool and as a component library can be found in the [examples folder](examples/). The `app` folder inside each example contains the source code of the application the example is for.

- [Android storybook with controls](https://storybookjs.github.io/native/@storybook/native-controls-example/index.html?path=/story/button--example)
- [Flutter storybook with controls](https://storybookjs.github.io/native/@storybook/native-flutter-example/index.html?path=/story/android--button)
- [iOS storybook with deep linking](https://storybookjs.github.io/native/@storybook/native-ios-example-deep-link/index.html?path=/story/button--example)

More example static storybooks can be found [here](https://storybookjs.github.io/native/)

## Debugging/testing your mobile application
Details on how to test changes that you make to your mobile application to support features such as controls can be found [here](APP-TESTING.md)
